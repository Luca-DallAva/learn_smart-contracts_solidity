#Vending Machine for sodas and snacks

RemixAI description:

This Solidity code defines a smart contract named VendingMachine. The contract is designed to represent a simple vending machine that sells two types of items: "sodas" and "snacks". Each item has an initial supply of 100 sodas and 50 snacks, but this quantity can be increased using the `restock` function if called by the contract owner.

The contract also allows users to purchase these items in exchange for Ether (ETH). The price of each "soda" is set at 2 ETH per unit, while the price of each "snack" is 3 ETH. This price can be adjusted as needed with further functions if more precise pricing were required.

The contract includes several public view functions to get information about the current stock levels and ownership:

- `getSodasBalance` returns the number of soda items left in stock.
- `getSnacksBalance` returns the number of snack items left in stock.
- `getItemsBalance` returns the total number of remaining items (sodas + snacks).

The contract also includes a `restock` function, which can be called by the owner to increase the supply of soda and/or snack items. The function takes two parameters: the amount of each item to add to the stock.

Finally, there are two public payable functions that allow users to purchase soda or snacks in exchange for ETH:

- `purchase_sodas` allows a user to buy a certain number of sodas by sending an appropriate amount of ETH. If enough ETH is sent and if the vending machine has enough sodas left, it will decrease the stock level of soda items in the contract (and possibly give some back)
- `purchase_snacks` does a similar thing for snack items. It also requires that there are enough snacks left to sell.

Please note: This is a simple example and should not be used as-is for real financial transactions, especially since gas fees need to be considered in Ethereum network transactions! Also, the smart contract owner has complete control over all functions within the contract which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not managed properly.
