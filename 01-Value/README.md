# Explanation via RemixAI of the contract

This Solidity contract is named "Value". It stores an integer value and a counter for tracking the number of times this value has been changed. The `value` is initialized with a user-provided integer when the contract is deployed, while the `counter` starts at 0.

There are three functions:

1. **Constructor** - When creating (deploying) an instance of this contract, you provide an initial value for the `value` variable and the `counter` is set to 0. The constructor is marked as public so it can be called externally by anyone but doesn't return anything since it isn't meant to return any values.

2. **set_value** - This function takes in a new integer value, sets this new value for the `value` variable and increases the counter by 1. It is marked as public so it can be called externally by anyone but doesn't return anything since it isn't meant to return any values.

3. **get_value** - This function returns a string with the current value of the `value` variable in this format: "The value is currently set to <currentValue>". It uses OpenZeppelin's String utilities for converting signed integers and it's marked as view which means that it doesn't modify any state.

4. **get_counter** - This function returns a string with the current counter of changes in this format: "The number of times the value has been changed is <currentCounter>". It uses OpenZeppelin's String utilities for converting unsigned integers and it's marked as view which means that it doesn't modify any state.
