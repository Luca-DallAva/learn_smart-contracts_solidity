# Explanation via RemixAI of the contract

This is a Solidity smart contract written in the Ethereum programming language. It's called `Value` and it has several features:

1. **State Variables**: The smart contract has two state variables, `value` (of type int256) and `counter` (uint256). These are public, meaning they can be accessed by anyone who has the address of this contract. 

2. **Constructor**: A constructor is a special function that gets called when a new instance of the smart contract is created. In this case, it takes one parameter `init_value` and sets both `value` and `counter` to their initial values.

3. **Functions**: The contract has three functions: 
   - A public function `set_value(int256 new_value)` that allows the owner of this contract to change the value of the `value` variable, while also incrementing the counter by one. This operation is not viewable on-chain and changes data.
   - Another public view function `get_value()` which returns a string concatenated with the current value of `value` using OpenZeppelin's Strings library. It doesn't change any data, hence it can be accessed by anyone.
   - A similar public view function `get_counter()` that returns a string concatenating the prefix "The number of times the value has been changed is " with the current counter value. Again, this doesn't change any data and can be accessed publicly.

4. **Receive Function**: The smart contract includes an external payable function `receive()` that accepts Ether but does not require any data to run (hence the term "payable"). This allows for receiving Ether without needing a specific function to handle it. 

5. **Function tips()**: The smart contract also has a public payable function called `tips()`, which can be used by users or contracts to send them Ether while also being able to execute some code if necessary (like updating the state of the contract).
