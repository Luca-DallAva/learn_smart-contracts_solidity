# Learning-Solidity
A few small projects for learning the basics of Solidity and smart contracts, which I hope can be as helpful to others as they are to me.

The main source I follow is https://www.youtube.com/@BlockExplorerMedia. 
That is Jonathan Spruance's YouTube channel (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-spruance-91493a126/). 
See also his GitHub repository: https://github.com/jspruance/block-explorer-tutorials/tree/main/smart-contracts/solidity.
